Write a shell script that computes the gross salary of a employee according to the
following rules:
i) If basic salary is < 1500 then HRA =10% of the basic and DA =90% of the
basic.
ii) If basic salary is >=1500 then HRA =Rs500 and DA=98% of the basic. The
basic salary is entered interactively through the key board.

echo "enter basic salary"
read sal
if [ $sal -lt 1500 ]
then
gs=$((sal+((sal/100)*10)+(sal/100)*90))
echo "the salalry is $gs "
fi
if [ $sal -ge 1500 ]
then
gs=$(((sal+500)+(sal/100)*98))
echo "the salary is $gs"
fi
