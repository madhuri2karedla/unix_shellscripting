Write a shell script which receives two file names as arguments. It should
check whether the two file contents are same or not. If they are same then
second file should be deleted.
echo -n "enter file1:"
read file1
echo -n "enter file2"
read file2
`cmp $file1 $file2>equal`
if [ ! -s equal ]
then
echo "same"
rm $file2
else
echo "different"
fi
